<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I am Soumya Ranjan Dash, a passionate and ambitious first-year B.Tech student at ITER College. My journey in academics has been shaped by a strong foundation built during my schooling years. I completed my 10th grade at Vikash School, where I developed a keen interest in science and technology. Moving forward, I pursued my 12th at DAV, further strengthening my knowledge and analytical skills.</p>

<p>Currently, as a B.Tech student, I am eager to explore the vast world of engineering and technology. I have a deep curiosity for problem-solving and innovation, which drives me to continuously learn and improve. My interests lie in coding, logical reasoning, and understanding how technology shapes the modern world. I am also pursuing a course in Full Stack Development to enhance my skills in web development and software engineering.</p>

<p>Apart from academics, I enjoy engaging in extracurricular activities that help me grow both personally and professionally. Whether it’s working on projects, participating in tech events, or collaborating with peers, I always strive to make the most of every opportunity that comes my way.
  This is me—I’ll change forever, as change is the only constant!
